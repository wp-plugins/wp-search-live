A super light-weight live search plugin that utilizes the WP REST API.

== Description ==

WP Live Search is a search plugin for WordPress that returns results as the user types for what they are looking. It supports posts, pages and custom post types.  

This is very much a working prototype, so please log any issues you find on the Github repo below.  

[https://github.com/bearded-avenger/wp-live-search](https://github.com/bearded-avenger/wp-live-search)  

Add the shortcode `[wp_live_search]` to a page or something. There's a few shortcode attributes that you can use, and are as follows:  

type=“”   
Your choices are `posts` or `pages`. Defaults to `posts`. You can also pass `type,type` to search multiple post types. For example type="recipes,books"

multi=“”   
By default this is turned off. Set this to true only if you're using multiple post types above.

placeholder=“”  
The text displayed in the input. Defaults to `Search...`.

results=“”  
The text displayed for the results. Defaults to `entries found`.

number=""    
Total search result to return. Default is 20

compact="true"    
Makes a tiny WP Live Search for use in header widgets and such

target=""   
An optional target UL parent to send the search results to. Example `target="#someotherdiv"`.
